This is a compiler that has educational purpose. the main ideia is to explain how flex and bison integration works.

The syntax supported by this project is variable declaration (with attribution) and the for statement.

examples:

var a = 43;
var b = 1001.45;
var c = a + b * 5;

The motivation for this project is the support of a compiler course at Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) at Brazil. url: www.cin.ufpe.br/~if688
